Growing vegetables in a sunny flat sounds like a great idea! For beginners with limited space and sunlight, 
I recommend starting with herbs like basil, parsley, or mint, which are relatively easy to grow indoors and don't require much maintenance.
 You could also try growing salad greens such as lettuce or spinach, as they can thrive in containers and only need moderate sunlight. 
 These options are not too demanding and can be quite rewarding for beginners.

To start growing peppers in your sunny flat, here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Choose the Right Variety:** Select a pepper variety suitable for indoor growing. Compact varieties like dwarf bell peppers or chili peppers are ideal for containers.

2. **Get the Right Container:** Use a pot or container with drainage holes at the bottom to prevent waterlogging. A 5-gallon container should be sufficient for most pepper plants.

3. **Soil Preparation:** Use well-draining potting soil rich in organic matter. You can mix in some compost for added nutrients.

4. **Planting:** Plant pepper seeds about ¼ inch deep in the soil, or transplant seedlings if you prefer. Space multiple plants about 18 inches apart to allow for growth.

5. **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch.

6. **Sunlight:** Place your pepper plants in a sunny spot where they can receive at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day. South-facing windows are usually ideal for indoor gardening.

7. **Temperature:** Peppers thrive in warm temperatures, ideally between 70-80°F (21-27°C) during the day and above 60°F (15°C) at night.

8. **Fertilizing:** Feed your pepper plants with a balanced fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season, following the instructions on the fertilizer package.

9. **Support:** Some pepper varieties may benefit from staking or trellising as they grow taller to support the weight of the fruit.

10. **Pests and Diseases:** Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids or whiteflies, and treat them promptly with insecticidal soap if necessary. Also, watch for signs of diseases such as powdery mildew and address them accordingly.

11. **Harvesting:** Peppers can be harvested once they reach their mature size and color. Simply snip them off the plant with scissors or pruners, leaving a short stem attached.

Following these steps should help you successfully grow peppers in your sunny flat. Enjoy your homegrown harvest!
